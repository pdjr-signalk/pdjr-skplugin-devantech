## Usage

__signalk-devantech__ has no special run-time usage requirement.

You can monitor the plugin's manipulation of the Signal K data tree by
reviewing the server state model in a web browser.

Status and error messages are written to the Signal K server logs.

### Simple use example

I use a two-channel USB relay module on my barge to interface my Signal K host
to my helm alarm system.
My alarm system is multi-channel and supported by beacon and sounder alerts
and I dedicate one channel to Signal K input triggered by the closing of one
of the relays.
The second relay connects directly with the beacon.
